a day in the life
i read the news today oh boy
about a lucky man who made the grade
and though the news was rather sad
well i just had to laugh
i saw the photograph.
he blew his mind out in a car
he didn’t notice that the lights had changed
a crowd of people stood and stared
they'd seen his face before
nobody was really sure
if he was from the house of lords.
i saw a film today oh boy
the english army had just won the war
a crowd of people turned away
but i just had to look
having read the book.
i'd love to turn you on
woke up, fell out of bed,
dragged a comb across my head
found my way downstairs and drank a cup,
and looking up i noticed i was late.
found my coat and grabbed my hat
made the bus in seconds flat
found my way upstairs and had a smoke,
somebody spoke and i went into a dream
i read the news today oh boy
four thousand holes in blackburn, lancashire
and though the holes were rather small
they had to count them all
now they know how many holes it takes to fill the albert hall.
i'd love to turn you on
a hard day's night
it’s been a hard day’s night, and i been working like a dog
it’s been a hard day's night, i should be sleeping like a log
but when i get home to you i'll find the things that you do
will make me feel alright
you know i work all day to get you money to buy you things
and it’s worth it just to hear you say you're going to give me everything
so why on earth should i moan, 'cause when i get you alone
you know i feel ok
when i'm home everything seems to be right
when i'm home feeling you holding me tight, tight
owww!

i dream of your first kiss, and then,
i feel upon my lips again,
a taste of honey... tasting much sweeter than wine.

across the universe
words are flowing out like endless rain into a paper cup,
they slither while they pass, they slip away across the universe
pools of sorrow, waves of joy are drifting through my open mind,
possessing and caressing me.
jai guru de va om
nothing's gonna change my world,
nothing's gonna change my world.
images of broken light which dance before me like a million eyes,
that call me on and on across the universe,
thoughts meander like a restless wind inside a letter box they
tumble blindly as they make their way
across the universe
jai guru de va om
nothing’s gonna change my world,
nothing’s gonna change my world.
sounds of laughter shades of earth are ringing
through my open views inviting and inciting me
limitless undying love which shines around me like a
million suns, it calls me on and on
across the universe
jai guru de va om
nothing’s gonna change my world,

fixing a hole
i'm fixing a hole where the rain gets in
and stops my mind from wandering
where will it go
i'm filling the cracks that ran through the door
and kept my mind from wandering
where will it go
and it really doesn’t matter if i'm wrong
i'm right
where i belong i’m right
where i belong.
see the people standing there who disagree and never win
and wonder why they don’t get in my door.
i'm painting my room in the colourful way
and when my mind is wandering
there i will go.
and it really doesn't matter if
i'm wrong i'm right
where i belong i'm right
where i belong.
silly people run around they worry me
and never ask me why they don't get past my door.
i'm taking the time for a number of things
that weren’t important yesterday
and i still go.
i'm fixing a hole where the rain gets in
and stops my mind from wandering
where it will go.
for no one
your day breaks, your mind aches
you find that all the words of kindness linger on
when she no longer needs you
she wakes up, she makes up
she takes her time and doesn’t feel she has to hurry
she no longer needs you
and in her eyes you see nothing
no sign of love behind the tears
cried for no one
a love that should have lasted years!
you want her, you need her
and yet you don't believe her when she said her love is dead
you think she needs you
and in her eyes you see nothing
no sign of love behind the tears
cried for no one
a love that should have lasted years!
you stay home, she goes out
she says that long ago she knew someone but now he's gone
she doesn't need him
your day breaks, your mind aches
there will be time when all the things she said will fil your head
you won't forget her
and in her eyes you see nothing
no sign of love behind the tears
cried for no one
a love that should have lasted years!
for you blue

happiness is a warm gun
she's not a girl who misses much
do do do do do do do do
she's well acquainted with the touch of the velvet hand
like a lizard on a window pane.
the man in the crowd with the multicoloured mirrors
on his hobnail boots
lying with his eyes while his hands are busy
working overtime
a soap impression of his wife which he ate
and donated to the nation trust.
i need a fix 'cause i'm going down
down to the bits that i left uptown
i need a fix cause i'm going down

when i hold you in my arms
and i feel my finger on your trigger
i know no one can do me no harm
because happiness is a warm gun

when i get near you,
the games begin to drag me down
it's all right
i'll make you maybe next time around
but if i seem to act unkind
it's only me, it’s not my mind
that is confusing things.
i want to tell you
i feel hung up but i don't know why,
i don't mind
i could wait forever, i've got time
sometimes i wish i knew you well,
then i could speak my mind and tell you
maybe you'd understand
i want to tell you

i don’t mind
i could wait forever, i've got time, i've got time, i've got time

but it never really mattered
i will always feel the same.
love you forever and forever
love you with all my heart
love you whenever we're together
love you when we're apart.

make it easy to be near you
for the things you do endear you to me
you know i will
i will.
i'll be back
you know if you break my heart i'll go, but i'll be back

heart again, this time i will try to show that i'm not trying to pretend.
i thought that you would realize that if i ran away from you that you would want
me too, but i've got a big surprise, oh ho, oh ho, oh

heart again, this time i will try to show that i'm not trying to pretend.
i wanna go but i hate to leave you, you know i hate to leave you, oh ho,
oh ho, oh
you, if you break my heart i'll go, but i'll be back again.
i'll cry instead
i’ve got every reason on earth to be mad, 'cause i've just
lost the only girl i had. if i could get my way, i'd get
myself locked up today, but i can't so i cry instead.
i've got a chip on my shoulder that's bigger than my feet, i
can't talk to people that i meet. if i could see you now,
i'd try to make you sad somehow, but i can't so i cry instead.
don't want to cry when there's people there, i get shy when
they start to stare, i'm gonna hide myself away, ay hay
but i'll come back again someday.
and when i do you’d better hide all the girls, i'm gonna
break their hearts all 'round the world. yes, i'm gonna
break them in two, and show you what your loving man can
do, until then i'll cry instead.

of all the love i have won or have lost
there is one love i should never have crossed
she was a girl in a million, my friend
i should have known she would win in the end
i'm a loser
and i lost someone who's near to me

you telling lies thinking i can't see
you don't cry 'cos you're laughing at me
i'm down (i’m really down)
i'm down (down on the ground)

i’m looking through you
i’m looking through you, where did you go
i thought i knew you, what did i know
you don’t look different, but you have changed
i’m looking through you, you’re not the same
your lips are moving, i cannot hear
your voice is soothing, but the words aren’t clear
you don’t sound differnt, i’ve learned the game.
i’m looking through you, you’re not the same
why, tell me why, did you not treat me right?
love has a nasty habit of disappearing overnight
you’re thinking of me, the same old way
you were above me, but not today
the only difference is you’re down there
i’m looking through you, any other way
why, tell me why, did you not treat me right?
love has a nasty habit of disappearing overnight
i’m looking through you, where did you go
i thought i knew you, what did i know
you don’t look different, but you have changed

i’m only sleeping
when i wake up early in the morning
lift my head, i’m still yawning
when i’m in the middle of a dream
stay in bed, float up stream (float up stream)
please, don’t wake me, no, don’t shake me
leave me where i am - i’m only sleeping
everybody seems to think i’m lazy
i don’t mind, i think they’re crazy
running everywhere at such a speed
till they find there’s no need (there’s no need)
please, don’t spoil my day, i’m miles away
and after all i’m only sleeping
keeping an eye on the world going by my window
taking my time
lying there and staring at the ceiling
waiting for a sleepy feeling...
please, don’t spoil my day, i’m miles away
and after all i’m only sleeping

taking my time

when i’m in the middle of a dream
stay in bed, float up stream (float up stream)
please, don’t wake me, no, don’t shake me
leave me where i am - i’m only sleeping
i’m so tired
i’m so tired, i haven’t slept a wink
i’m so tired, my mind is on the blink
i wonder should i get up and fix myself a drink
no,no,no.
i’m so tired i don’t know what to do
i’m so tired my mind is set on you
i wonder should i call you but i know what you’d do
you’d say i’m putting you on
but it’s no joke, it’s doing me harm
you know i can’t sleep, i can’t stop my brain
you know it’s three weeks, i’m going insane
you know i’d give you everything i’ve got
for a little peace of mind
i’m so tired, i’m feeling so upset
although i’m so tired i’ll have another cigarette
and curse sir walter raleigh
he was such a stupid guest.
i’ve got a feeling
i’ve got a feeling, a feeling deep inside
oh yeah, oh yeah.
i’ve got a feeling, a feeling i can’t hide
oh no. oh no, oh no,
yeah i’ve got a feeling.
oh please believe me, i’d hate to miss the train
oh yeah, oh yeah.
and if you leave me i won’t be late again
oh no, oh no, oh no.
yeah i’ve got a feeling yeah.
all these years i’ve been wandering around,
wondering how come nobody told me
all that i was looking for was somebody
who looked like you.
ev’rybody had a hard year
ev’rybody had a good time
ev’rybody had a wet dream,
ev’rybody saw the sunshine
oh yeah, oh yeah.
ev’rybody had a good year,
ev’rybody let their hair down,
ev’rybody pulled their socks up,
ev’rybody put their foot down.
oh yeah, oh yeah.
i’ve just seen a face
i’ve just seen a face,
i can’t forget the time or place
where we just meet.
she’s just the girl for me
and want all the world to see
we’ve met, mmm-mmm-mmm-m’mmm-mmm.
had it been another day
i might have looked the other way
and i’d have never been aware.
but as it is i’ll dream of her
tonight, di-di-di-di’n’di.
falling, yes i am falling,
and she keeps calling
me back again.
i have never known
the like of this, i’ve been alone
and i have missed things
and kept out of sight
but other girls were never quite
like this, da-da-n’da-da’n’da.
falling, yes i am falling,
and she keeps calling
me back again.
falling, yes i am falling,
and she keeps calling
me back again.
i’ve just seen a face,
i can’t forget the time or place
where we just meet.
she’s just the girl for me
and want all the world to see
we’ve met, mmm-mmm-mmm-da-da-da.
falling, yes i am falling,
and she keeps calling
me back again.
falling, yes i am falling,
and she keeps calling
me back again.
oh, falling, yes i am falling,
and she keeps calling
me back again.
if i fell
if i fell in love with you
would you promise to be true
and help me understand
cause i’ve been in love before
and i found that love was more
than just holding hands
if i give my heart to you
i must be sure
from the very start
that you would love me more than her
if i trust in you oh please
don’t run and hide
if i love you too oh please
don’t hurt my pride like her
cause i couldn’t stand the pain
and i would be sad if our new love was in vain
so i hope you see that i
would love to love you
and that she will cry
when she learns we are two
if i fell in love with you
if i needed someone
if i needed someone to love
you’re the one that i’d be thinking of
if i needed someone
if i had some more time to spend
then i guess i’d be with you my friend
if i needed someone
had you come some other day
it might not have been like this
but you see now i’m too much in love
carve your number on my wall
and maybe you will get a call from me
if i needed someone
ah, ah, ah, ah
if i had some more time to spend
then i guess i’d be with you my friend
if i needed someone
had you come some other day
it might not have been like this
but you see now i’m too much in love
carve your number on my wall
and maybe you will get a call from me
if i needed someone
ah, ah
in my life
there are places i’ll remember
all my life though some have changed
some forever not for better
some have gone and some remain
all these places have their moments
with lovers and friends i still can recall
some are dead and some are living
in my life i’ve loved them all
but of all these friends and lovers
there is no one compares with you
and these memories lose their meaning
when i think of love as something new
though i know i’ll never lose affection
for people and things that went before
i know i’ll often stop and think about them
in my life i love you more
though i know i’ll never lose affection
for people and things that went before
i know i’ll often stop and think about them
in my life i love you more
in my life i love you more
it won’t be long
ev’ry night when ev’rybody has fun,
here am i sitting all on my own,
it won’t be long yeh, yeh,
it won’t be long yeh, yeh,
it won’t be long yeh, yeh,
till i belong to you.
since you left me i’m so alone,
now you’re coming, you’re coming home,
i’ll be good like i know i should,
you’re coming home, you’re coming home.
ev’ry night the tears come down from my eyes,
ev’ry day i’ve done nothing but cry.
it won’t be long yeh, yeh.
since you left me i’m so alone,
now you’re coming, you’re coming home,
i’ll be good like i know i should,
you’re coming home, you’re coming home.
ev’ry day we’ll be happy, i know,
now i know that you won’t leave me no more.
it won’t be long yeh, yeh.
it’s all too much
it’s all too much, it’s all too much
when i look into your eyes, your love is there for me
and the more i go inside, the more there is to see
it’s all too much for me to take
the love that’s shining all around you
everywhere, it’s what you make
for us to take, it’s all too much
floating down the stream of time, of life to life with me
makes no difference where you are or where you’d like to be
it’s all too much for me to take
the love that’s shining all around here
all the world’s a birthday cake,
so take a piece but not too much
set me on a silver sun, for i know that i’m free
show me that i’m everywhere, and get me home for tea
it’s all to much for me to see
a love that’s shining all around here
the more i am, the less i know
and what i do is all too much
it’s all too much for me to take
the love that’s shining all around you
everywhere, it’s what you make
for us to take, it’s all too much
it’s too much.....it’s too much
too much too much too much (fade to end)
it’s only love
i get high when i see you go by
my oh my.
when you sigh, my, my inside just flies,
butterflies
why am i so shy when i’m beside you?
it’s only love and that is all,
why should i feel the way i do?
it’s only love, and that is all,
but it’s so hard loving you.
is it right that you and i should fight
ev’ry night?
just the sight of you makes nighttime bright,
very bright.
haven’t i the right to make it up girl?
it’s only love and that is all,
why should i feel the way i do?
it’s only love, and that is all
but it’s so hard loving you
yes it’s so hard loving you -- loving you.
julia
half of what i say is meaningless
but i say it just to reach you, julia
julia, julia, oceanchild, calls me
so i sing a song of love, julia
julia, seashell eyes, windy smile, calls me
so i sing a song of love, julia
her hair of floating sky is shimmering, glimmering,
in the sun
julia, julia, morning moon, touch me
so i sing a song of love, julia
when i cannot sing my heart
i can only speak my mind, julia
julia, sleeping sand, silent cloud, touch me
so i sing a song of love, julia
hum hum hum hum...calls me
so i sing a song of love for julia, julia, julia

lady madonna
lady madonna, children at your feet.
wonder how you manage to make ends meet.
who finds the money? when you pay the rent?
did you think that money was heaven sent?
friday night arrives without a suitcase.
sunday morning creep in like a nun.
monday’s child has learned to tie his bootlace.
see how they run.
lady madonna, baby at your breast.
wonder how you manage to feed the rest.
see how they run.
lady madonna, lying on the bed,
listen to the music playing in your head.
tuesday afternoon is never ending.
wednesday morning papers didn’t come.
thursday night you stockings needed mending.
see how they run.
lady madonna, children at your feet.
wonder how you manage to make ends meet.

mother mary comes to me
speaking words of wisdom, let it be.

nothing can come between us,
when it gets dark i tow your heart away.
standing by a parking meter,
when i caught a glimpse of rita,
filling in a ticket in her little white book.
in a cap she looked much older,
and the bag across her shoulder
made her look a little like a military man.
lovely rita meter maid,
may i inquire discreetly,
when are you free,
to take some tea with me.
took her out and tried to win her,
had a laugh and over dinner,
told her i would really like to see her again,
got the bill and rita paid it,
took her home i nearly made it,
sitting on the sofa with a sister or two.
oh, lovely rita meter maid,
where would i be without you,
give us a wink and make me think of you.
lucy in the sky with diamonds
picture yourself in a boat on a river,
with tangerine trees and marmalade skies
somebody calls you, you answer quite slowly,
a girl with kaleidoscope eyes.
cellophane flowers of yellow and green,
towering over your head.
look for the girl with the sun in her eyes,
and she’s gone.
lucy in the sky with diamonds.
lucy in the sky with diamonds.
lucy in the sky with diamonds.
follow her down to a bridge by a fountain
where rocking horse people eat marshmellow pies,
everyone smiles as you drift past the flowers,
that grow so incredibly high.
newspaper taxis appear on the shore,
waiting to take you away.
climb in the back with your head in the clouds,
and you’re gone.
lucy in the sky with diamonds.
lucy in the sky with diamonds.
lucy in the sky with diamonds.
picture yourself on a train in a station,
with plasticine porters with looking glass ties,
suddenly someone is there at the turnstyle,
the girl with the kaleidoscope eyes.

mother nature’s son
born a poor young country boy--mother nature’s son
all day long i’m sitting singing songs for everyone.
sit beside a mountain stream--see her waters rise
listen to the pretty sound of music as she flies.
find me in my field of grass--mother nature’s son
swaying daises sing a lazy song beneath the sun.
mother nature’s son.

no reply.
they said it wasn’t you,
but i saw you peep through your window,
i saw the light, i saw the light,
i know that you saw me,
cos i looked up to see your face.
i tried to telephone,
they said you were not home,
that’s a lie,
cause i know where you’ve been,
i saw you walk in your door,
i nearly died, i nearly died,
cause you walked hand in hand
with another man in my place.
if i were you i’d realize that i
love you more than any other guy,
and i’ll forgive the lies that i
heard before when you gave me no reply.

norwegian wood
i once had a girl, or should i say, she once had me...
she showed me her room, isn’t it good, norwegian wood?
she asked me to stay and she told me to sit anywhere,
so i looked around and i noticed there wasn’t a chair.
i sat on a rug, biding my time, drinking her wine.
we talked until two and then she said, it’s time for bed
she told me she worked in the morning and started to laugh.
i told her i didn’t and crawled off to sleep in the bath
and when i awoke, i was alone, this bird had flown
so i lit a fire, isn’t it good, norwegian wood.
not a second time
you know you made me cry,
i see no use in wond’ring why,
i cried for you.
and now, you’ve changed your mind,
i see no reason to change mine,
i cried, it’s through, oh.
oh, you’re giving me the same old line,
i’m wond’ring why,
you hurt me then, you’re back again,
no, no, not a second time.

i want a love that’s right but right is only half of what’s wrong.
i want a short haired girl who sometimes wears it twice as long.
now i’m stepping out this old brown shoe, baby, i’m in love with you.

and when i see your smile replace every thoughtless frown.

who knows, baby, you may comfort me.
i may appear to be imperfect, my love is something you can’t reject.
i’m changing faster than the weather if you and me should get together
who knows, baby, you may comfort me.
that love of your, to miss that love is something i’d hate.
i’ll make an early start, i’m making sure that i’m not late.
for you sweet top lip i’m in the queue, baby, i’m in love with you.
i’m so glad you came here, it won’t be the same now when i’m with you.

penny lane
in penny lane there is a barber showing photographs
of every head he’s had the pleasure to know.
and all the people that come and go
stop and say hello.
on the corner is a banker with a motorcar,
the little children laugh at him behind his back.
and the banker never wears a mack
in the pouring rain, very strange.
penny lane is in my ears and in my eyes.
there beneath the blue suburban skies
i sit, and meanwhile back
in penny lane there is a fireman with an hourglass
and in his pocket is a portrait of the queen.
he likes to keep his fire engine clean,
it’s a clean machine.
penny lane is in my ears and in my eyes.
a four of fish and finger pies
in summer, meanwhile back
behind the shelter in the middle of a roundabout
the pretty nurse is selling poppies from a tray
and tho’ she feels as if she’s in a play
she is anyway.
in penny lane the barber shaves another customer,
we see the banker sitting waiting for a trim.
and then the fireman rushes in
from the pouring rain, very strange.
penny lane is in my ears and in my eyes.
there beneath the blue suburban skies
i sit, and meanwhile back.
penny lane is in my ears and in my eyes.
there beneath the blue suburban skies,
penny lane.
piggies
have you seen the little piggies
crawling in the dirt
and for all the little piggies
life is getting worse
always having dirt to play around in.
have you seen the bigger piggies
in their starched white shirts
you will find the bigger piggies
stirring up the dirt
always have clean shirts to play around in.
in their styes with all their backing
they don’t care what goes on around
in their eyes there’s something lacking
what they need’s a damn good whacking.
everywhere there’s lots of piggies
living piggy lives
you can see them out for dinner
with their piggy wives
clutching forks and knives to eat their bacon.

rain
if the rain comes they run and hide their heads.
they might as well be dead.
if the rain comes, if the rain comes.
when the sun shines they slip into the shade
(when the sun shines down.)
and drink their lemonade.
(when the sun shines down.)
when the sun shines, when the sun shines.
rain, i don’t mind.
shine, the weather’s fine.
i can show you that when it starts to rain,
(when the sun shines down.)
everything’s the same.
(when the sun shines down.)
i can show you, i can show you.
rain, i don’t mind.

if the rain comes they run and hide their heads.

by the banks of her own lagoon

sunday’s on the phone to monday,
tuesday’s on the phone to me
she said she’d always been a dancer
she worked at 15 clubs a day
and though she thought i knew the answer
well i knew what i could not say.
and so i quit the police department
and got myself a steady job
and though she tried her best to help me
she could steal but she could not rob
didn’t anybody tell her?
didn’t anybody see?

and you know that can’t be bad.
yes, she loves you
and you know you should be glad. ooh!

i know what it is to be sad
and she’s making me feel like i’ve never been born.
i said who put all those things in your hair
things that make me feel that i’m mad
and you’re making me feel like i’ve never been born.
she said you don’t understand what i said
i said no, no, no, you’re wrong
when i was a boy everything was right
everything was right
i said even though you know what you know
i know that i’m ready to leave
cause you’re making me feel like i’ve never been born.
she said you don’t understand what i said

she’s leaving home
wednesday morning at five o’clock as the day begings
silently closing her bedroom door
leaving the note that she hoped would say more
she goes downstairs to the kitchen clutching her hankerchief
quietly turing the backdoor key
stepping outside she is free.
she (we gave her most of our lives)
is leaving (sacraficed most of our lives)
home (we gave her everything money could buy)
she’s leaving home after living alone
for so many years. bye, bye
father snores as his wife gets into her dressing gown
picks up the letter that’s lying there
standing alone at the top of the stairs
she breaks down and cries to her husband
daddy our baby’s gone.
why would she treat us so thoughtlessly
how could she do this to me.
she (we never though of ourselves)
is leaving (never a thought for ourselves)
home (we struggled hard all our lives to get by)
she’s leaving home after living alone
for so many years. bye, bye
friday morning at nine o’clock she is far away
waiting to keep the appointment she made
meeting a man from the motor trade.
she what did we do that was wrong
is having we didn’t know it was wrong
fun fun is the one thing that money can’t buy
something inside that was always denied
for so many years. bye, bye

the ballad of john and yoko
standing in the dock at southampton,
trying to get to holland or france.
the man in the mac said, you’ve got to turn back.
you know they didn’t even give us a chance.
christ you know it ain’t easy,
you know how hard it can be.
the way things are going
they’re going to crucify me.
finally made the plane into paris,
honey mooning down by the seine.
peter brown called to say,
you can make it o.k.,
you can get married in gibraltar, near spain.
christ you know it ain’t easy,
you know how hard it can be.
the way things are going
they’re going to crucify me.
drove from paris to the amsterdam hilton,
talking in our beds for a week.
the newspapers said, say what you doing in bed?
i said, we’re only trying to get us some peace.
christ you know it ain’t easy,
you know how hard it can be.
the way things are going
they’re going to crucify me.
saving up your money for a rainy day,
giving all your clothes to charity.
last night the wife said,
oh boy, when you’re dead
you don’t take nothing with you
but your soul - think!
made a lightning trip to vienna,
eating chocolate cake in a bag.
the newspapers said, she’s gone to his head,
they look just like two gurus in drag.
christ you know it ain’t easy,
you know how hard it can be.
the way things are going
they’re going to crucify me.
caught an early plane back to london.
fifty acorns tied in a sack.
the men from the press said, we wish you success,
it’s good to have the both of you back.
christ you know it ain’t easy,
you know how hard it can be.
the way things are going
they’re going to crucify me.
the way things are going
they’re going to crucify me.
the continuing story of bungalow bill
hey, bungalow bill

bungalow bill?
he went out tiger hunting with his elephant and gun
in case of accidents he always took his mom
he’s the all american bullet-headed saxon mother’s son.
all the children sing

deep in the jungle where the mighty tiger lies
bill and his elephants were taken by surprise
so captain marvel zapped in right between the eyes
all the children sing

what did you kill
bungalow bill?
the children asked him if to kill was not a sin
not when he looked so fierce, his mother butted in
if looks could kill it would have been us instead of him
all the children sing
hey, bungalow bill
what did you kill
bungalow bill?
the end
oh yeah, all right
are you going to be in my dreams
tonight?
and in the end
the love you take
is equal to the love you make.
the fool on the hill
day after day alone on the hill,
the man with the foolish grin is keeping perfectly still,
but nobody wants to know him,
they can see that he’s just a fool,
and he never gives an answer,
but the fool on the hill
sees the sun going down,
and the eyes in his head,
see the world spinning around.
well on his way his head in a cloud,
the man of a thousand voices talking percetly loud
but nobody ever hears him,
or the sound he appears to make,
and he never seems to notice,
but the fool on the hill . . .
nobody seems to like him
they can tell what he wants to do.
and he never shows his feelings,
but the fool on the hill . . .
the inner light
without going out of my door
i can know all things of earth
with out looking out of my window
i could know the ways of heaven
the farther one travels
the less one knows
the less one really knows
without going out of my door
you can know all things of earth
with out looking out of my window
you could know the ways of heaven
the farther one travels
the less one knows
the less one really knows
arrive without travelling
see all without looking
do all without doing
the long and winding road that leads to your door,
will never disappear,
i’ve seen that road before it always leads me here,
leads me to your door.
the wild and windy night the rain washed away,
has left a pool of tears crying for the day.
why leave me standing here, let me know the way
many times i’ve been alone and many times i’ve cried
anyway you’ll never know the many ways i’ve tried, but
still they lead me back to the long and winding road
you left me standing here a long, long time ago
don’t leave me waiting here, lead me to you door
da, da, da, da--

but i never heard them ringing
no i never heard them at all
till there was you
there were birds in the sky
but i never saw them winging
no i never saw them at all
till there was you
then there was music and wonderful roses
they tell me in sweet fragrant meadows of dawn and you
there was love all around
but i never heard it singing
no i never heard it at all
till there was you
then there was music and wonderful roses
they tell me in sweet fragrant meadows of dawn and you
there was love all around
but i never heard it singing
no i never heard it at all
till there was you
till there was you
tomorrow never knows
turn off your mind, relax and float down stream,
it is not dying, it is not dying
lay down al thoughts, surrender to the void,
it is shining, it is shining.
yet you may see the meaning of within
it is being, it is being
love is all and love is everyone
it is knowing, it is knowing
and ignorance and hate mourn the dead
it is believing, it is believing
but listen to the colour of your dreams
it is not leaving, it is not leaving
so play the game existence to the end
of the beginning, of the beginning

two of us
two of us riding nowhere
spending someone’s
hard earned pay
two of us sunday driving
not arriving
on our way back home
we’re on our way home
we’re on our way home
we’re going home
two of us sending postcards
writing letters
on my wall
you and me burning matches
lifting latches
on our way back home
we’re on our way home
we’re on our way home
we’re going home
you and i have memories
longer than the road that stretches out ahead
two of us wearing raincoats
standing so low
in the sun
you and me chasing paper
getting nowhere
on our way back home
we’re on our way home
we’re on our way home
we’re going home
you and i have memories
longer than the road that stretches out ahead

we’re on our way home
we’re going home
we’re going home
better believe it
wait
it’s been a long time
now i’m coming back home
i’ve been away now
oh how i’ve been alone
wait till i come back to your side
we’ll forget the tears we’ve cried
but if your heart breaks
don’t wait, turn me away
and if your heart’s strong
hold on, i won’t delay
wait till i come back to your side
we’ll forget the tears we’ve cried
i feel as though
you ought to know
that i’ve been good
as good as i can be
and if you do
i’ll trust in you
and know that you
will wait for me
it’s been a long time
now i’m coming back home

we can work it out
try to see it my way,
do i have to keep on talking till i can’t go on?
while you see it your way,
run the risk of knowing that our love may soon be gone.
we can work it out,
we can work it out.
think of what you’re saying.
you can get it wrong and still you think that it’s alright.
think of what i’m saying,
we can work it out and get it straight, or say good night.
we can work it out,
we can work it out.
life is very short, and there’s no time
for fussing and fighting, my friend.
i have always thought that it’s a crime,
so i will ask you once again.
try to see it my way,
only time will tell if i am right or i am wrong.
while you see it your way
there’s a chance that we may fall apart before too long.
we can work it out,
we can work it out.

what goes on
what goes on in your heart?
what goes on in your mind?
you are tearing me apart
when you treat me so unkind
what goes on in your mind
the other day i saw you
as i walked along the road
but when i saw him with you
i could feel my future fold
it’s so easy for a girl like you to lie
tell me why
what goes on in your heart?
what goes on in your mind?
you are tearing me apart
when you treat me so unkind
what goes on in your mind
i met you in the morning
waiting for the tides of time
but now the tide is turning
i can see that i was blind
it’s so easy for a girl like you to lie
tell me why
what goes on in your heart?
i used to think of no on else
but you were just the same
you didn’t even think of me
as someone with a name
did you mean to break my heart and watch me die
tell me why
what goes on in your heart?
what goes on in your mind?
you are tearing me apart
when you treat me so unkind
what goes on in your mind
in your mind
in your mind
what you’re doing
look what you’re doing, i’m feeling blue and lonely,
would it be too much to ask you,
what you’re doing to me?
you got me running and there’s no fun in it,
why should it be so much to ask of you,
what you’re doing to me?
i’ve been waiting here for you,
wond’ring what you’re gonna do,
should you need a love that’s true,
it’s me.
please stop your lying, you’ve got me crying, girl,
why should it be so much to ask of you,
what you’re doing to me?
what you’re doing to me.
when i get home
whoa-ho, whoa-ho,
i got a whole lot of things to tell her,
when i get home.
come on, out of my way,
cause i’m gonna see my baby today,
i’ve got a whole lot of things i’ve gotta say
to her.
whoa-ho, whoa-ho,
i got a whole lot of things to tell her,
when i get home.
come on if you please,
i’ve got no time for trivialities,
i’ve got a girl who’s waiting home for me tonight.
whoa-ho, whoa-ho,
i got a whole lot of things to tell her,
when i get home.
when i’m getting home tonight, i’m gonna
hold her tight.
i’m gonna love her till the cows come home,
i bet i’ll love her more,
till i walk out that door
again.
come on, let me through,
i’ve got so many things, i’ve got to do,
i’ve got no business being here with you
this way.
whoa-ho, whoa-ho,
i’ve got a whole lot of things to tell her
when i get home - yeah.
when i’m sixty-four
when i get older losing my hair,
many years from now.
will you still be sending me a valentine
birthday greetings bottle of wine.
if i’d been out till quarter to three
would you lock the door,
will you still need me, will you still feed me,
when i'm sixty-four.
you'll be older too,
and if you say the word,
i could stay with you.
i could be handy, mending a fuse
when your lights have gone.
you can knit a sweater by the fireside
sunday mornings go for a ride,
doing the garden, digging the weeds,
who could ask for more.
will you still need me, will you still feed me,
when i’m sixty-four.
every summer we can rent a cottage,
in the isle of wight, if it's not too dear
we shall scrimp and save
grandchildren on your knee
vera chuck and dave
send me a postcard, drop me a line,
stating point of view
indicate precisely what you mean to say
yours sincerely, wasting away
give me your answer, fill in a form
mine for evermore
will you still need me, will you still feed me,
when i’m sixty-four.
while my guitar gently weeps
i look at you all see the love there that’s sleeping
while my guitar gently weeps
i look at the floor and i see it needs sweeping
still my guitar gently weeps
i don’t know why nobody told you how to unfold your love
i don’t know how someone controlled you
they bought and sold you.
i look at the world and i notice it’s turning
while my guitar gently weeps
with every mistake we must surely be learning
still my guitar gently weeps
i don’t know how you were diverted
you were perverted too
i don’t know how you were inverted
no one alerted you.
i look at you all see the love there that’s sleeping
while my guitar gently weeps
look at you all...
still my guitar gently weeps.
why don’t we do it in the road?
why don’t we do it in the road?
no one will be watching us
why don’t we do it in the road?
wild honey pie
honey pie,
honey pie,
i love you, honey pie
within you without you
we were talking-about the space between us all
and the people-who hide themselves behind a wall of illusion
never glimpse the truth-then it’s far too late-when they pass away.
we were talking-about the love we all could share-when we find it
to try our best to hold it there-with our love
with our love-we could save the world-if they only knew.
try to realise it’s all within yourself
no-one else can make you change
and to see you’re really only very small,
and life flows within you and without you.
we were talking-about the love that’s gone so cold and the people,
who gain the world and lose their soul-
they don’t know-they can’t see-are you one of them?
when you’ve seen beyond yourself-then you may find, peace of mind,
is waiting there-
and the time will come when you see
we’re all one, and life flows on within you and without you.
words of love
hold me close and tell me how you feel
tell me love is real
words of love you whisper soft and true
darling i love you
let me hear you say the words i long to hear
darling when you’re near
words of love you whisper soft and true
darling i love you
yellow submarine
yellow submarine... and we would march till
three in the day to see them gather there. from
land of goats to jonah green we’d step in duty
trail to see his yellow submarine, we love it
in the town where i was born
lived a man who sailed to sea
and he told us of his life
in the land of submarines
so we sailed up to the sun
till we found the sea of green
and we lived beneath the waves
in our yellow submarine
we all live in our yellow submarine,
yellow submarine, yellow submarine
we all live in our yellow submarine,
yellow submarine, yellow submarine
and our friends are all on board

yellow submarine, yellow submarine
as we live a life of ease
everyone of us has all we need
sky of blue and sea of green
in our yellow submarine.
we all live in our yellow submarine,
yellow submarine, yellow submarine
we all live in our yellow submarine,
yellow submarine, yellow submarine
we all live in our yellow submarine,
yellow submarine, yellow submarine
we all live in our yellow submarine,
yellow submarine, yellow submarine
