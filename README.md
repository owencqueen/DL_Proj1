# DL_Proj1
This repo actually contains code for all projects (other than final project) in COSC 525: Deep Learning with Dr. Amir Sadovnik at the University of Tennessee, Knoxville. All projects were completed by me and [Sai Thatigotla](https://github.com/saithat).

## Project Outline:

**[Project 1](https://github.com/owencqueen/DL_Proj1/blob/main/project1.py):** Neural Networks in Numpy

**[Project 2](https://github.com/owencqueen/DL_Proj1/blob/main/project2.py):** Convolutional Neural Networks in Numpy

**[Project 3](https://github.com/owencqueen/DL_Proj1/tree/main/Project3):** Exploring CNN architectures

**[Project 4](https://github.com/owencqueen/DL_Proj1/tree/main/Project4):** RNNs and LSTMs for Natural Language Processing
